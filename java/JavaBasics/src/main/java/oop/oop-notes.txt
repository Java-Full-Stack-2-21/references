What is oop? (Object Oriented Programming)
    OOP is a programming ideology in which we reference "objects" to reference real world objects

What are the 4 pillars of OOP?
    - Inheritance
        Inheritance is the concept of passing state/behavior from a parent class to a child class
        - Example: DNA, you are passed DNA from your parents
        - How do we achieve this in java?
            We utilize the extends keyword on a class. (NOTE: We can only extend one class)
    - Abstraction
        abstraction is the idea of hiding how something is done.
        Example: A car. We dont know how a car accelerates, the car just goes when I hit the pedal.
        Where do we see abstraction in java?
            - interfaces
            - abstract classes
    - Encapsulation
        encapsulation is the restriction of direct access.
        Example:
            - Vending machine... you dont get the snickers, the machine does for you.
        Where do we see this in java?
            - with the use of access modifiers
                - public, private, default, protected
    - Polymorphism
        Polymorphism is the idea of taking on many forms.
        Example: Water... water can act differently depending on temperature and shape
        Where do we see polymorphism in Java?
            - overriding: method with the same method signature as a method in the same class
            - overloading: a method has the same name as another method in the class but with different parameters
