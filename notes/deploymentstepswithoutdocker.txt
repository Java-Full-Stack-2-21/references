Frontend:
	1: utilizes the environment folder if there are variables that are for deployment
		- environment.ts is for development
		- environment.prod.ts is for when you build the project with ngbuild
	2: ng build
		- packaged the entire project into 4 or 5 files
		- these files are located in the dist folder
	3: place contents in dist folder into an s3 bucket that can host static pages.
		- you can enable static hosting under the properties tab in the s3 instance

Backend:
	1: utilize environment variables if some value are going to change for deployment
		- if its a java file, you can use System.getenv(ENV GOES HERE);
		- if its the application.properties file, you can use ${ENV VARIABLE GOES HERE}
		- if its anything else, GOOGLE
	2: create an ec2 instance (I used ubuntu free tier for this example)
		- to remotely access the virtual machine:
			- ssh -i [LOCATION OF YOUR PEM FILE] ubuntu@[EC2_PUBLIC_IP]
			- you can also add an ssh configuration in the file ~/.ssh/config
	3: update the security group to open up the port that your server is going to run on
		- you can go to the security group by click the link under security when you are looking at the ec2 details
	4: add environment variables needed for the ec2
		- modify the file in ~/.bashrc and add the following command
			- export [ENV_NAME]=[ENV_VALUE]
			- if you have more than one environment variable, youll be doing the above command multiple times
	5: install the following programs to your EC2
		- jdk
		- mvn
		- git
			- NOTE: run sudo apt update before installing
	5: clone the project to the ec2
	6: go to the directory that is the project is at in the ec2 and run "mvn package"
		- this creates a java executable in jar format
	7: run the jar file in the background
		- nohup java -jar [location of jar file] &
