# DIY Exercise
You will be provided a boilerplate ```index.html``` that contains a plain list of items.

Your task is to change the background color of every even-numbered item to the color blue using only JS (no direct CSS coding allowed). Provide your solution in a JS file.

You are only allowed to use JS documentation to help you find a solution. 

**DO NOT** copy your batchmate's solution or an third-party, online solution. This exercise is to assess your abilities in coding JavaScript.

During your next one-on-one session with your trainer, you will show your solution to your trainer.

Good Luck!
