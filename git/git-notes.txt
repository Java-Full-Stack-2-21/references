 
What is a repository?
	a place where we can store things

What is git?
	- version control system (VCS) and collaboration tool
	- it allows us to share our files in a repository


What is github?
	online git hosting service.

Centralized vs Distributed VCS
	- Centralized VCS uses a central location to store all of the source code, data and records.
		- there are many issues wiith this...
			- What if we lose internet?
			- What if the remote centralized location goes down?
	- Distributed VCS creates a COPY of the source code on each user's machine
		-if you lose internet, you can still work on the source code locally


Common git commands:
	git init: creates a new git repo locally
	git add [FILENAME]: adds file to staging
		- git add . : adds all files from the current directory and children directories to staging
		- git add -a: adds all changes from any file in the repository to staging
	git commit -m "MESSAGE GOES HERE": adds all changes that are in staging to an official commit LOCALLY
	git push: send latest commits from local repo to remote repository
	git pull: get latest commits from remote repo to local repository
	git clone [GITHUB REPO URL]: get remote repo to local machine for the first time.
	git log: displays all commits made
	git status: displays whats in staging
