What is Docker?
	- a platform for running applications utilizing the idea of a container


What is a container?
	- a container bundles up the libraries needed to run your application
	- a container is much more lightweight than a virtual machine


3 concepts we need to understand
	- Dockerfile
	- Docker Image
	- Docker Container

What is a Dockerfile?
	- A file that contains the instructions needed to get all the resources needed to create a docker image

What is a Docker Image?
	- A Docker image has everything needed to run your application (filesystem, libraries, dependencies...etc)

A Docker container runs your docker image


A Dockerfile generates your Docker Image
A Docker Image is ran on your Docker Container


Common docker commands:
	- docker images: list all of your local images
	- docker build -t todobackend .    : builds docker image from Dockerfile
	- docker run -p 9000:9000 todobackend : runs the specified docker image in a new container
	- docker stop [CONTAINER_ID] : stops container
	- docker start [CONTAINER_ID] : starts container
	- docker rm [CONTAINER_ID] : rm docker container
